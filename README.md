## Welcome! 

#In this application, we will visualize sorting algorithms. 

Seven types of sorting algorithms were first looked at: 
1. Merge 
2. Quick
3. Selection
4. Insertion
5. Heap
6. Shell
7. Bubble
8. Radix Sort 
9. Gnome Sort
10. Bogo Sort

Coming soon: 

11. Cocktail Shaker Sort 
12. Binary Insertion Sort 


# Prerequisites 

You need at least python3.3. You can download 
python3.3 from this [link](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.0/)

Check your version of python before continuing forward. This uses 'yield from' which isn't in python 2

# Instructions 

On your terminal, type in:

`        python main.py           `

You will be prompted to enter a number. You are free to choose any number 
but be wary that the higher the number you, the longer it will take for you 
to see the output and the slower your computer will be (debateable, my computer 
is just generally slow).

If you entered a valid number, then you will be prompted to choose a sorting 
algorithm. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to implement a case where I could 
place all of them side by side. For now, if you want to compare two sorting 
algorithms, you'll have to do it one by one. 

If you didn't enter a valid number or you entered a valid number or didn't choose 
a specific sorting algorithm, you will force quit. 

Have fun!
